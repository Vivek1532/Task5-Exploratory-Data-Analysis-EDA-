# 📊 Data Analyst Internship – Task 5

## 🧾 Task Title:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

---

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this task was to extract meaningful insights from the dataset using statistical analysis and visualization techniques.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📂 Dataset Used
Titanic Dataset

The dataset contains information about passengers such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Passenger Class
- Fare
- Survival Status
- Family details

---

## 🔎 Steps Performed in EDA

### ✅ 1. Data Understanding
- Used `.info()` to check data types
- Used `.describe()` for statistical summary
- Used `.value_counts()` for categorical distribution

### ✅ 2. Missing Value Analysis
- Identified missing values using `.isnull().sum()`
- Observed missing values in Age and Cabin columns

### ✅ 3. Univariate Analysis
- Histogram for Age distribution
- Countplot for Survival
- Boxplot for Fare distribution

### ✅ 4. Bivariate Analysis
- Survival vs Gender
- Age vs Survival
- Correlation Heatmap

### ✅ 5. Multivariate Analysis
- Pairplot to understand relationships between multiple features

## 📈 Key Insights
- Females had higher survival rate than males.
- Higher class passengers had better survival chances.
- Fare shows presence of outliers.
- Younger passengers had relatively better survival probability.
- Survival is positively correlated with Fare.
