## ❓ What is EDA and why is it important?

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) is the process of analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics using statistics and visualizations.

It is important because:
• It helps understand the dataset structure.
• It identifies missing values and outliers.
• It detects patterns and relationships.
• It prepares data for modeling.

## ❓ Which plots are used to check correlation?

• Heatmap
• Pairplot
• Scatterplot
• Correlation matrix

Heatmap visually shows strength of relationships between variables.

## ❓ How do you handle skewed data?

• Apply log transformation
• Use square root transformation
• Remove outliers
• Use robust scaling

---

## ❓ How to detect multicollinearity?

• Check correlation matrix
• Use Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)
• Identify highly correlated independent variables

---

## ❓ What are univariate, bivariate and multivariate analyses?

Univariate:
• Analysis of one variable (e.g., histogram)

Bivariate:
• Analysis of two variables (e.g., scatterplot)

Multivariate:
• Analysis of more than two variables (e.g., pairplot)

## ❓ Difference between heatmap and pairplot?

Heatmap:
• Shows correlation values numerically.
• Uses color intensity to represent strength.

Pairplot:
• Shows scatterplots between multiple variables.
• Helps visualize distribution and relationships.

## ❓ How do you summarize your insights?

• Identify patterns and trends.
• Highlight important correlations.
• Mention anomalies or outliers.
• Provide business-relevant conclusions.
